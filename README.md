Hello there! Glad you opened this before downloading BatchNichrome. This is malware.
This was created for educational purposes and NOT for destroying your PC. Only run the batch file if you are testing it in a safe environment, a VM. If you have no idea what a malware is or anything, DO NOT CLICK THE .BAT FILE.
What this virus does is delete your C:/ drive entirely. If you are using it in a safe environment like a VM, then run the batch file as administator for the .bat to function. No warnings are given before the .bat is run.
